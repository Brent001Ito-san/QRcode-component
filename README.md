## Overview

Hello world! I'm Andrew Nderitu " Ito-san". As an aspiring Computer Science student, my passion for web development led me to embark on a journey to enhance my frontend skills. 
The challenge entails creating a visually appealing webpage featuring a QR code provided by Frontend Mentor. The challenge is to craft a website that closely resembles the provided design while adhering to the prescribed guidelines. This project serves as an ideal entry point for newcomers(newbies - HTML and CSS), offering an excellent platform to sharpen my web development skills and gain hands-on experience in a guided and supportive environment. By replicating the given design and following the provided instructions,I can storm through the web development journey with enthusiasm and confidence, honing my abilities and building a foundation for future endeavors.

## My process
üòëüëà
- Applied reverse engineering to break down the webpage into components.
- Identified each component and created pseudocode for the HTML to simplify the process.
- Utilized paint to determine specific div heights and widths, following straightforward instructions for design.
- CSS proved challenging, but with guidance from my friend Elvisüëà and support from ChatGPT, I successfully navigated through it.
- Embraced a harmonious blend of human expertise, my struggle and AI assistance, resulting in a captivating project that fueled my passion for continuous learning and growth in web development.
- I acknowledge the fact that using chatGTP or any other AI language is not the best practise of learning, but in this case chatGTP proved that it can also be a mentor in learning as not all questions I could raise to Elvis as this would be stubborn and irritating. Although there is a discord or slack community in frontend mentor, I'm and introvert so AI real saved on this one. But in the future I would really like to start showing off my skills and acknowledging others people solutions.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this exciting journey, I've discovered that CSS can be a real time-sucker in web design. To tackle it head-on, I'm determined to master the CSS basics, a game-changer for future UI/UX aspirations.

But guess what? I found a genius shortcut to speed up my HTML game! Emmet shorthand syntax rocks! üòèüí™üî•
Just check out this snappy code: `.parent>.attributes+main>div.QR+div.text`.

And you know what's the real secret sauce? Believe in yourself üòé and do your research right. No fluff, just pure confidence and grit. That's how I've leveled up as a web developer, and there's no stopping me now. Ready to dive into new challenges with boldness!

### Continued development

I want to sharpen my CSS skills and improve some tricks in HTML so as to make the design seamless.
Also I will embark on Javascript journey to master JS and make website more interactive and beautiful.
Learn UI/UX for future website - aesthetic webpages. 

### Useful resources

- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me in importing the fonts, but also taught me that there's no need to go through the hustle and bustle of trying to get a font the I desire, because it's already madeüòÅ 
- Well Elvis had to be here coz he really helped my along the way, hopefully in the future I will not need him or AI and infact I'll be the one guiding others.
